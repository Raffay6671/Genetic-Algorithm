**Genetic Algorithms on Cars**

This project implements a genetic algorithm to optimize car navigation through a track with checkpoints. Each car is equipped with sensors that detect obstacles and determine movement directions based on predefined rules. The goal is to maximize the number of checkpoints crossed by evolving car behaviors across generations. For detailed documentation, refer to the provided Word file.
